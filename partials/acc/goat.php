echo '<p>Goat skins are narrowest in width beneath their shoulders where the shape naturally scoops inwards. Should you require a rectangular panel, the maximum width will be determined by this narrow point.</p>
     	<p>If an alternative shape is requested (circle, tall and thin rectangle, square etc.) it may be possible to cut a shape with a wider width, or a taller length.</p>
     	<p><em>Skin sizes and dimensions are always taken from averages and are therefore approximate.</em></p>';
