  echo '<p>These cow hide leather pieces are cut from the butt of the hide as this section provides beautifully even-textured leather. When new, faint shave lines from the underside of the leather can sometimes be visible across the panels. With time and use these naturally fade away, and we often find that the handling of the leather by your upholsterer is enough for these lines to mellow and fade away.</p>
        <p><em>Piece sizes and dimensions are always taken from averages and are therefore approximate.</em></p>';
